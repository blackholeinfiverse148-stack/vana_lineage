# VANA Lineage Dashboard — G4 Control Center Integration Complete ✓

## Summary

The VANA Lineage Dashboard has been successfully integrated with the real G4 backend to display the GOVERNED_ABSTENTION result for the SAMACHAR observation flow. The dashboard now fetches live data from the full Group 1 → Group 2 → Group 4 runtime chain and displays the governance outcome in a read-only, semantically-aware UI.

**Status**: ✅ LIVE INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## How to Run the Dashboard

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed (for HTTP server)
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Network access to the deployed Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4 APIs

### Step 1: Navigate to the Dashboard Directory
```bash
cd "c:\Users\vijay\Downloads\Vana_lineage_dashboard-main\Vana_lineage_dashboard-main"
```

### Step 2: Start the Local HTTP Server
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Why HTTP server?** When opening HTML files directly via `file://`, modern browsers assign the origin `null`, which is blocked by CORS policies on remote APIs. The HTTP server provides a proper `http://localhost` origin.

### Step 3: Open the Dashboard in Browser
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/vana-lineage-viewer-1.html
```

### Step 4: Fetch Live APIs
Click the **"Fetch from live APIs"** button to query the real Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4 runtimes.

---

## Live API Endpoints

All endpoints are pre-configured in the dashboard. No additional setup required.

| Group | Purpose | Endpoint | Method | Status |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Group 1** | Canonical MasterDB API | `http://163.128.209.18:8013` | GET `/observations/{observation_id}` | ✅ Healthy |
| **Group 2** | Context & Decision Brain | `https://niyantran.blackholeinfiverse.com/api/group2/context/resolve` | POST | ✅ Healthy |
| **Group 4** | Intake Runtime & Governed Outcome | `http://163.128.209.18:8010/vana/execute` | POST | ✅ Healthy |

### Request/Response Flow

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Observation ID**: `SMR-Z01-EXT-SAMACHAR-OBS001` pinned in sticky header  
✅ **Canonical Record**: `CR-c3d2e7cc-3ddc-41d6-a85c-b782cf43801d` retrieved from Group 1  
✅ **Context ID**: `null` preserved (not replaced or guessed)  
✅ **Group 2 Decision**: `ABSTAIN` with `action_eligibility: false`  
✅ **Group 4 Status**: `governed_abstention` with `decision_action: noop`  
✅ **Abstention Record**: Real ID from backend, not hardcoded  
✅ **Event ID**: Real trace ID from backend  
✅ **Execution ID**: Real execution ID from backend  
✅ **All API Health Chips**: Green (all three groups responding)  
✅ **Live Success Banner**: "LIVE SUCCESS — Full runtime chain connected directly in browser (Group 1 → Group 2 → Group 4)"  

---

## How to Verify the Live Result in the UI

### Visual Indicators
1. **Top Banner**: Shows "LIVE SUCCESS" in green when all APIs respond successfully
2. **Health Chips** (below canonical observation):
   - **Group 1 API**: Green dot + "healthy"
   - **Group 2 API**: Green dot + "healthy"
   - **Group 4 API**: Green dot + "healthy"
3. **Lineage Section**: Displays all cross-group trace IDs and record IDs
4. **Group 4 Card**: 
   - Title: "GOVERNED ABSTENTION" (not "Governed Outcome")
   - Status field: "governed_abstention"
   - Event type: "GOVERNED_ABSTENTION"
   - Ruling: "ABSTAIN"
   - Decision block: Tan/yellow background with "NO ACTION / NOOP"

### Console Verification
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console for:
```
[VANA UI] Live fetch initiated for observation: SMR-Z01-EXT-SAMACHAR-OBS001
[VANA DEBUG] Group 1 raw response: {...}
[VANA DEBUG] Group 2 raw response: {...}
[VANA DEBUG] Group 4 raw response: {...}
[VANA UI] Group 1 response status: 200
[VANA UI] Group 2 response status: 200
[VANA UI] Group 4 response status: 200
```

### Click "Show raw response ▾" in Each Card
Expand the raw response sections in Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4 cards to see:
- Complete JSON response from each runtime
- Verify the actual backend responses are being rendered (not mocked)
- Check request/response timestamps match

---

## Important Design Guarantees Maintained

✅ **Strict Fail-Closed Execution Order**
- If Group 1 fails, pipeline halts immediately (no Group 2 or Group 4 calls)
- If Group 2 fails, pipeline halts immediately (no Group 4 call)
- If Group 4 fails, error is rendered without retroactive defaults

✅ **Pinned Canonical Observation ID**
- `observation_id` in sticky header is never replaced by any downstream ID
- Always shows: `SMR-Z01-EXT-SAMACHAR-OBS001`

✅ **Nothing Invented**
- Missing fields render as `NOT VERIFIED`, `PENDING`, or `GAP`
- Never blank, never guessed, never carried over from previous observations
- All displayed data comes directly from live API responses

✅ **Governed Abstention is NOT Action Request**
- Title automatically changes to "GOVERNED ABSTENTION" (not "Action Request")
- Color and layout driven by `action_eligibility: false` and `abstention_required: true`
- Never defaults to the "normal" action path

✅ **No CORS Bypass**
- Uses standard browser fetch API with CORS headers
- Never uses opaque `no-cors` mode
- All responses readable and logged to console

✅ **Live Mode vs. Demo Mode**
- Strictly separate
- Demo/sample payloads only rendered in "Paste sample payload" tab
- No mixing of modes

---

## No Endpoint Creation Required

**⚠️ Important**: All API endpoints already exist in deployed runtimes:
- No new endpoints were invented or configured
- No backend modifications were made
- The dashboard simply consumes existing Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4 APIs
- The backend already handles the SAMACHAR observation correctly

If the endpoints were missing, the integration would fail at step 1 and report:
```
LIVE FETCH BLOCKED — Browser access to Group 1 blocked or incomplete.
```

Instead, all three APIs respond successfully with status `200`.

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### For Deployment
1. Update Group 1 and Group 4 CORS policies if not already enabled:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],
       allow_credentials=False,
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```

2. Serve from a production web server instead of `http.server`:
   ```bash
   # Example: nginx, Apache, or cloud CDN
   ```

3. Pin the stable observation ID in deployment:
   - Current: Editable input field (useful for testing)
   - Deployment: Could be hardcoded or injected at serve time

### For Additional Features
- Add export to JSON/PDF for audit trails
- Add time-series tracking of observation lineage across re-runs
- Add filtering/searching across multiple observations
- Add webhook notifications when governance status changes

## Support & Troubleshooting

### "CORS blocked" error?
- Ensure Group 1 and Group 4 APIs have CORS middleware enabled
- Dashboard must be served from `http://` or `https://`, not `file://`

### "Network unreachable" error?
- Verify IP addresses: `http://163.128.209.18:8013` and `http://163.128.209.18:8010`
- Check firewall/VPN permissions to reach those IPs

### "Observation not found" (404)?
- Verify the observation ID exists in Group 1 database
- Try a known-good observation ID temporarily

### Functions undefined in browser?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check for JavaScript syntax errors in Console

### Different Event IDs on each fetch?
- **This is correct behavior** — each Group 4 execution generates new trace IDs
- Not a caching issue; each invocation creates a new event record
